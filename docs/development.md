`src/` contains the runtime; lifecycle entry points are in `src/scripts/`. Installation copies the runtime to `~/.config/upwsh` and excludes `src/tests/`. `src/prompt.psm1` provides the native `username@host folder branch ❯` prompt and does not depend on Starship.

## Tests

Run from the repository root with PowerShell 7:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_completion.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_path_commands.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_git_completion.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_git_cache.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_prompt.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_prompt_renderer.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_prompt_segments.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_theme.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_term.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_interaction.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_install_profile.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_upwsh.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_install.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/test_deploy_locks.ps1
```

The test harness uses temporary user homes and profiles and disables persistent environment writes.

## Deployment

Install/update validate staged files before changing the installation. V2 deployment also checks the headers of existing bundled theme filenames before any program changes; an old theme blocks deployment with backup/replacement instructions rather than being overwritten or left incompatible with the new renderer. They keep live directories in place because Windows directory handles can prevent whole-tree renames. Changed program files use same-volume file replacement with a backup journal; unchanged files, tools, existing custom settings, and local themes are left in place. Missing custom templates and bundled themes are added and journaled.

A caught deployment error restores completed file changes and environment settings. A locked program file causes a failure naming that file; the installer does not kill the owning process or require elevation. If rollback itself fails, recovery files remain and their locations are reported. Replacement is atomic per file, not across the entire installation; process termination or power loss is outside this rollback guarantee. Install then runs `upwsh load`. If eza, dust, or btm are missing from PATH or `tool\bin`, install prints `upwsh tool install` for those names and does not download them. Update keeps the existing profile hook. Uninstall runs `upwsh unload` first.

The lock tests use temporary installations and Windows handles that deny rename/delete, including locked tool and custom files.

## Git completion

`src/git_completion.psm1` handles common Git command positions before filesystem completion. It reads refs and configured remotes only when requested by Tab, without contacting a remote. Each query has a 500ms process wait limit and leaves `$LASTEXITCODE` unchanged. Subcommand names need no Git process. The scope is intentionally limited; unknown syntax returns to normal completion.

Successful raw queries are cached for 1 second, capped at 16 entries with oldest-entry eviction. Keys include the working directory, executable, ordered `-C` and query arguments, and Git environment overrides. Actual command input clears query data; empty Enter does not. Failed or timed-out queries are not cached. Git executable discovery is reused until Path, PATHEXT, working directory, or executable availability changes.

Git completion tests create and remove isolated local repositories with fixture branches, tags, and remote-tracking refs. Cache tests use Git Trace2 to count real queries. They do not modify the project repository or access remotes.

## Path conversion

`src/path_convert.ps1` defines `winpath` and `unixpath`. Interactive input, completion, command output, and setup share these interfaces. The Enter handler decides which arguments to convert; the converter functions only transform path text.

Standalone installers contain generated copies so `irm | iex` works before installation. After editing the converter, synchronize and check those copies:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/scripts/sync_path_convert.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/scripts/sync_path_convert.ps1 -Check
```

## Native prompt

`src/prompt.psm1` reads local `.git/HEAD` directly at a repository root. In subdirectories and worktrees, one local `git rev-parse --git-path HEAD` query locates it (250ms process wait limit). This also works before the first commit. Each actual render reads fresh branch data; only the completed prompt text is cached by `hook.psm1`. Empty Enter and editing redraws neither read Git nor launch subprocesses. Detached HEAD uses a `detached@<short-sha>` label.

The bundled `pure-classic` theme in `src/themes/pure-classic.json` preserves the user's Starship `pure` visual reference, without parsing TOML or executing Starship. `src/theme.psm1` accepts only v2 `Order`/`Modules`, validates and fills defaults once per load, and persists the selected filename in `custom/theme.json`. Changing its revision invalidates the rendered prompt cache. The renderer resolves visible built-in data first, then literal text and attached connectors using neighboring visible backgrounds. There is no v1 compatibility layer. See [Themes](themes.md) for settings and update/uninstall behavior.

In pure-classic, user/host is `#22C55E`, the italic folder is `#EAB308`, the branch is `#06B6D4`, duration is `#73DACA`, the bold success character is `#0DB447`, and the bold error code and character are `#D15B71`. Both states use `❯` and one trailing space. Failures print the numeric effective exit code immediately before `❯`; there is no `!` or extra error icon. Duration appears at 2,000ms, uses milliseconds (`2s345ms`), and precedes the error code without an extra separator, matching the reference format. The hook reuses the monotonic duration already recorded by terminal reporting, even when OSC is disabled.

The user's folder-only requirement overrides the reference's three-component path truncation: home is `~`, a drive root is `/c`, and other filesystem locations display their last folder name. Colors are truecolor ANSI, disabled for redirected output, `TERM=dumb`, or `NO_COLOR`. Tests can use `Get-UpwshPromptText -Color Always/Never` for deterministic captures.

## Performance

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/bench_prompt.ps1 -Enforce
python src/tests/bench_console.py --enforce
python src/tests/bench_console.py --completion --samples 20
python src/tests/bench_console.py --lifecycle
python src/tests/bench_console.py --osc
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/bench_term.ps1
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/bench_interaction.ps1 -Files 1000 -Samples 10
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File src/tests/bench_git_completion.ps1 -Samples 20
```

- `bench_startup.py --baseline <snapshot>/src/profile.ps1 --candidate src/profile.ps1 --runs 7` alternates fresh ConPTY processes and reports startup-to-input-ready medians and ranges. Use `--output <file.json>` to retain samples and `--max-ratio 0.95` to require at least a 5% median reduction. This measures process startup, profile loading, first rendering and input setup together, not reboot-cold disk access or the terminal application's window painting. Each process uses a temporary user home; configured themes/custom files come from the supplied runtime trees. Without a ratio gate, completion means measurements were collected, not that an optimization passed.
- `bench_prompt.ps1` measures profile loading, the first prompt, and empty Enter handling.
- `bench_console.py` sends Enter through Windows ConPTY. `--completion` creates a temporary Git repository, types `git pull origin `, and presses Tab without executing the command. It checks that listing candidates preserves the buffer and does not rerun the prompt renderer or emit prompt-boundary events. `--lifecycle` checks actual Ctrl+L/Ctrl+C, multiline cancellation, alternate submission, failure, and interruption behavior. It requires Python and uses only the standard library.
- `bench_term.ps1` reports OSC formatting time, byte count, and sequence count; `bench_console.py --osc` verifies protocol order on the wire.
- `bench_interaction.ps1` measures terminal reporting and file completion with generated files.
- `bench_git_completion.ps1` compares fresh queries with immediate repeats in the current repository, including word completion and its trailing space. The first query still starts Git; different query types do not share cache entries.

The empty Enter target is p95 below 30ms. Startup and completion have separate measurements; ConPTY timings exclude the terminal application's screen painting. Compare repeated runs on the same machine, since system load affects the results.

`PSConsoleHostReadLine` records submitted code after PSReadLine returns, independent of the submit key. Empty/comment-only input and editing cancellation leave the cached prompt valid. A pending command is consumed once by the next prompt, including failure or execution interruption. While PSReadLine is editing, prompt redraws do not emit command-finished or prompt-boundary events. Idle new input lines emit prompt boundaries and may close the abandoned input with an unnumbered D, but never a false numbered command result. End time is captured before rendering, and the last success/exit snapshot survives idle redraws.

Directory, window-width, and selected-theme changes also invalidate the rendered text. Branch/status changes made elsewhere are not polled: they appear after a command in this shell. This snapshot policy deliberately favors predictable low-latency editing.

Explicit path completion queries the filesystem first. Candidate display reuses that keypress's results; the next Tab queries again to see filesystem changes. Idle terminal reports send only changed fields. Command completion resynchronizes the full snapshot to restore state possibly changed by child processes. See [Terminal Reporting](terminal-reporting.md) for field definitions, configuration, privacy, and protocol tests.
